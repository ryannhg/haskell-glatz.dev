## Oh, hello.

My name is Ryan and I like building things. Video games, CMS platforms, or a portfolio website like this one- if it's a thing, I'll code it.

I enjoy tacos and long walks to [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) conferences.

But I wasn't _always_ this way. Let me tell you about my journey:

### It all started in high school.

Me and my boy Scott started learning Java in our junior year.

```java
public class Main
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

Next thing you know, we were making `BankAccount` classes and using polymorphism and it was nuts. Extending things, making interfaces. Mostly just a lot of typing.

### Next stop: .NET

My other pal Ryan had a dad who had a company that wrote C# all day. they were Microsoft everything over there, so Java was out and C# was in!


```csharp
public class Main
{
    public static void Main (String[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

Fortunately for me, it turned out to be the exact same language.

It was a close one, I almost had to learn something new.

### being a college person

Me, Scott, and Ryan decided we liked coding. Through a completely uncoordinated series of events, we all ended up going to U of I to study computer things.

Scott and Ryan studied Computer Science, while I studied Computer Engineering. I was building robotic cars, operating systems, and all kinds of fun things.

```c++
int main ()
{
    cout << "Hello, world!"; 
    return 0;
}
```

Hey, look! Less typing!

### my first website

It was during the junior year of college that I built my first website.

```html
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
```

```js
console.log('Hello world!')
```

```css
h1 {
  content: 'hello world';
}
```

okay so maybe css isn't supposed to do that, but whatever. Finally, I was learning new languages and things.

The best part? I could code everything once, and I could share it with all my friends! Mobile, tablet, desktop, MacOS, PC, Linux, Android, iOS- all of the things could access my application.

I fell in love with responsive design and web development and have been a fan ever since.

### getting a job.

After college, I got to work at a digital web agency where we built websites for a living. It was pretty sweet man.

I was doing AngularJS, .NET, Drupal, Wordpress, NodeJS, VueJS, React, and on my _lucky_ days I got to debug jQuery.

Life was good, JavaScript was life. And then I met sweet Elm.

### elm, sweet elm.

On a train ride home in September of 2016, I read an article about "functional programming". It was really interesting, and flipped my world view on its head.

When I got back to my apartment, I kept looking into it.

```elm
main =
    text "Hello, world!"
```

It looked spooky as hell, but I pushed into that discomfort.

A few months went by and Elm completely broke apart the way I used to build software. I started doing functional JavaScript. I started watching Rich Hickey tech talks.

I even started pretending to know what "monad" meant!

### the present day.

Right now, I'm building a new website in Hugo, a static site generator built with Go. Before that, I was eating some Chipotle, and watching a Clojure tech talk. And tomorrow, I'll continue building my custom CMS: [Jangle](https://www.jangle.io).

But right now, I'm going to deploy this bad boy to Netlify and share it with my buddy Rene at work tomorrow. __Hello, Rene!__
